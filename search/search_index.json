The most widely used way to interact with personal computers is called a graphical user interface (GUI). With a GUI, we give instructions by clicking a mouse and using menu-driven interactions.</p> <p>While the visual aid of a GUI makes it intuitive to learn, this way of delivering instructions to a computer scales very poorly. Imagine the following task: for a literature search, you have to copy the third line of one thousand text files in one thousand different directories and paste it into a single file. Using a GUI, you would not only be clicking at your desk for several hours, but you could potentially also commit an error in the process of completing this repetitive task. This is where we take advantage of the Unix shell. The Unix shell is both a command-line interface (CLI) and a scripting language, allowing such repetitive tasks to be done automatically and fast. With the proper commands, the shell can repeat tasks with or without some modification as many times as we want. Using the shell, the task in the literature example can be accomplished in seconds.</p>"},{"location":"1_background_introduction/#the-shell","title":"The Shell","text":"<p>A shell is a computer program that presents a command line interface which allows you to control your computer using commands entered with a keyboard instead of controlling graphical user interfaces (GUIs) with a mouse/keyboard/touchscreen combination.</p> Shell for Bioinformatics <ul> <li>Many bioinformatics tools can only be used through a command line interface. Many more have features and parameter options which are not available in the GUI. BLAST is an example. Many of the advanced functions are only accessible to users who know how to use a shell.</li> <li>The shell makes your work less boring. In bioinformatics you often need to repeat tasks with a large number of files. With the shell, you can automate those repetitive tasks and leave you free to do more exciting things.</li> <li>The shell makes your work less error-prone. When humans do the same thing a hundred different times (or even ten times), they\u2019re likely to make a mistake. Your computer can do the same thing a thousand times with no mistakes.</li> <li>The shell makes your work more reproducible. When you carry out your work in the command-line (rather than a GUI), your computer keeps a record of every step that you\u2019ve carried out which you can use to re-do your work when you need to. It also gives you a way to communicate unambiguously what you\u2019ve done, so that others can inspect or apply your process to new data.</li> <li>Many bioinformatic tasks require large amounts of computing power and can\u2019t realistically be run on your own machine.

It organizes our data into files, which hold information, and directories (also called \"folders\"), which hold files or other directories.</p> <p>Several commands are frequently used to create, inspect, rename, and delete files and directories.\\</p> <p>code</p> <pre><code>$ \n</code></pre> <p>The dollar sign is a prompt, which shows us that the shell is waiting for input; your shell may use a different character as a prompt and may add information before the prompt. When typing commands, either from these lessons or from other sources, do not type the prompt, only the commands that follow it.</p> <p>Let's find out where we are by running a command called <code>pwd</code> (which stands for \"print working directory\"). At any moment, our current working directory is our current default directory, i.e. the directory that the computer assumes we want to run commands in, unless we explicitly specify something else. Here, the computer's response is <code>/users/group/user</code>, which is the top level directory within BMRC:</p> <p>code</p> <pre><code>$ pwd\n</code></pre> <pre><code>/users/group/user\n</code></pre> <p>Let's look at how our file system is organized. We can see what files and subdirectories are in this directory by running <code>ls</code>, which stands for \"listing\":</p> <p>code</p> <pre><code>$ ls\n</code></pre> <pre><code>shell_data\n</code></pre> <p><code>ls</code> prints the names of the files and directories in the current directory in alphabetical order, arranged neatly into columns. We'll be working within the <code>shell_data</code> subdirectory,  and creating new subdirectories, throughout this workshop.</p> <p>The command to change locations in our file system is <code>cd</code>, followed by a directory name to change our working directory. <code>cd</code> stands for \"change directory\".</p> <p>Let's say we want to navigate to the <code>shell_data</code> directory we saw above. We can use the following command to get there:</p> <p>code</p> <pre><code>cd shell_data\n</code></pre> <p>and take a look</p> <pre><code>$ ls\n</code></pre> <pre><code>sra_metadata  untrimmed_fastq\n</code></pre> <p>We can make the <code>ls</code> output more comprehensible by using the flag <code>-F</code>, which tells <code>ls</code> to add a trailing <code>/</code> to the names of directories:</p> <p>code</p> <pre><code>$ ls -F\n</code></pre> <pre><code>sra_metadata/  untrimmed_fastq/\n</code></pre> <p>what is <code>/</code></p> <p>Anything with a <code>/</code> after it is a directory. Things with a \"*\" after them are programs. If there are no decorations, it's a file.</p> <p><code>ls</code> has lots of other options. To find out what they are, we can type:</p> <pre><code>$ man ls\n</code></pre> <p><code>man</code> (short for manual) displays detailed documentation (also referred as man page or man file) for <code>bash</code> commands. It is a powerful resource to explore <code>bash</code> commands, understand their usage and flags. Some manual files are very long. You can scroll through the file using your keyboard's down arrow or use the Space key to go forward one page and the b key to go backwards one page. When you are done reading, hit q to quit.</p> <p>Busy looking terminal ? time to \ud83c\udd91</p> <p>Type the word <code>clear</code> into the terminal and press the <code>Enter</code> key.</p> <p>code</p> <pre><code>$ clear\n</code></pre> <p>This will scroll your screen down to give you a fresh screen and will make it easier to read. You haven't lost any of the information on your screen. If you scroll up, you can see everything that has been output to your screen up until this point.</p> <p>Hot-key combinations are shortcuts for performing common commands.</p> <p>The hot-key combination for clearing the console is <code>Ctrl+L</code>. Feel free to try it and see for yourself.</p> <p>Challenge</p> <p>Use the <code>-l</code> option for the <code>ls</code> command to display more information for each item in the directory.

Instead we can use tab complete as a shortcut. When you start typing out the name of a directory or file, then hit the Tab key, the shell will try to fill in the rest of the directory or file name.</p> <p>Return to your home directory:</p> <p>code</p> <pre><code>$ cd\n</code></pre> <p>then enter:</p> <pre><code>$ cd she&lt;tab&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>The shell will fill in the rest of the directory name for <code>shell_data</code>.</p> <p>Now change directories to <code>untrimmed_fastq</code> in <code>shell_data</code></p> <p>code</p> <pre><code>$ cd shell_data\n$ cd untrimmed_fastq\n</code></pre> <p>Using tab complete can be very helpful. However, it will only autocomplete a file or directory name if you've typed enough characters to provide a unique identifier for the file or directory you are trying to access.</p> <p>For example, if we now try to list the files which names start with <code>SR</code> by using tab complete:</p> <p>code</p> <pre><code>$ ls SR&lt;tab&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>The shell auto-completes your command to <code>SRR09</code>, because all file names in the directory begin with this prefix.

This tells you that you are in a directory called <code>training</code>, which sits inside a directory called <code>home</code> which sits inside the very top directory in the hierarchy. The very top of the hierarchy is a directory called <code>/</code> which is usually referred to as the root directory. So, to summarize: <code>training</code> is a directory in <code>home</code> which is a directory in <code>/</code>. More on <code>root</code> and <code>home</code> in the next section.</p> <p>Now enter the following command:</p> <pre><code>$ cd /users/group/user/shell_data/.hidden\n</code></pre> <p>This jumps forward multiple levels to the <code>.hidden</code> directory.

The first uses the absolute path, giving the full address from the home directory. The second uses a relative path, giving only the address from the working directory. A full path always starts with a <code>/</code>. A relative path does not.</p> <p>A relative path is like getting directions from someone on the street. They tell you to \"go right at the stop sign, and then turn left on Main Street\". That works great if you're standing there together, but not so well if you're trying to tell someone how to get there from another country. A full path is like GPS coordinates. It tells you exactly where something is no matter where you are right now.</p> <p>You can usually use either a full path or a relative path depending on what is most convenient. If we are in the home directory, it is more convenient to enter the full path.

This may be different for other language-specific layouts.</p> <p>What <code>|</code> does is take the output that is scrolling by on the terminal and uses that output as input to another command. When our output was scrolling by, we might have wished we could slow it down and look at it, like we can with <code>less</code>. Well it turns out that we can! We can redirect our output from our <code>grep</code> call through the <code>less</code> command.</p> <p>code</p> <pre><code>$ grep -B1 -A2 NNNNNNNNNN SRR098026.fastq | less\n</code></pre> <p>We can now see the output from our <code>grep</code> call within the <code>less</code> interface. We can use the up and down arrows to scroll through the output and use <code>q</code> to exit <code>less</code>.</p> <p>If we don't want to create a file before counting lines of output from our <code>grep</code> search, we could directly pipe the output of the grep search to the command <code>wc -l</code>. This can be helpful for investigating your output if you are not sure you would like to save it to a file.</p> <p>Code</p> <pre><code>$ grep -B1 -A2 NNNNNNNNNN SRR098026.fastq | wc -l\n</code></pre> <p>Because we asked <code>grep</code> for all four lines of each FASTQ record, we need to divide the output by four to get the number of sequences that match our search pattern. Since 802 / 4 = 200.5 and we are expecting an integer number of records, there is something added or missing in <code>bad_reads.txt</code>. If we explore <code>bad_reads.txt</code> using <code>less</code>, we might be able to notice what is causing the uneven number of lines.

Similar to wildcards and tab completion, using loops also reduces the amount of typing (and typing mistakes). Loops are helpful when performing operations on groups of sequencing files, such as unzipping or trimming multiple files. We will use loops for these purposes in subsequent analyses, but will cover the basics of them for now.</p> <p>When the shell sees the keyword <code>for</code>, it knows to repeat a command (or group of commands) once for each item in a list. Each time the loop runs (called an iteration), an item in the list is assigned in sequence to the variable, and the commands inside the loop are executed, before moving on to the next item in the list. Inside the loop, we call for the variable's value by putting <code>$</code> in front of it. The <code>$</code> tells the shell interpreter to treat the variable as a variable name and substitute its value in its place, rather than treat it as text or an external command. In shell programming, this is usually called \"expanding\" the variable.</p> <p>Basic Structure of a <code>for</code> loop</p> <p>The basic structure of a bash for loop looks like this: </p><pre><code>for variable in list\ndo\n    commands\ndone\n</code></pre><p></p> <p>Let's break down each part:</p> <ol> <li><code>for</code>: This keyword starts the loop.</li> <li><code>variable</code>: This is a temporary variable that takes on each value in the list, one at a time.</li> <li><code>in</code>: This keyword separates the variable from the list.</li> <li><code>list</code>: This is the set of items you want to loop through.</li> <li><code>do</code>: This keyword marks the beginning of the commands to be executed in each iteration.</li> <li><code>commands</code>: These are the actions you want to perform for each item in the list.</li> <li><code>done</code>: This keyword marks the end of the loop.</li> </ol> <p>Here's a simple example to help you understand: </p><pre><code>for fruit in apple banana orange\ndo\n    echo \"I like $fruit\"\ndone\n</code></pre> This loop will output: <pre><code>I like apple\nI like banana\nI like orange\n</code></pre><p></p> <p>How does it work: </p> <ol> <li>The loop starts with \"apple\" as the value of fruit.</li> <li>It executes the echo command with this value.</li> <li>Then it moves to the next item, \"banana\", and repeats.</li> <li>Finally, it does the same with \"orange\".</li> </ol> <p>After the last item, the loop ends.</p> <p>Remember, you can put any commands inside the loop, and they will be executed for each item in your list. This makes for loops a powerful tool for automating repetitive tasks in bash scripting.</p> <p>Let's write a for loop to show us the first two lines of the fastq files we downloaded earlier. You will notice the shell prompt changes from <code>$</code> to <code>&gt;</code> and back again as we were typing in our loop. The second prompt, <code>&gt;</code>, is different to remind us that we haven't finished typing a complete command yet.</p> <pre><code>$ cd ../untrimmed_fastq/\n</code></pre> <pre><code>$ for filename in *.fastq\n&gt; do\n&gt; head -n 2 ${filename}\n&gt; done\n</code></pre> <p>The for loop begins with the formula <code>for &lt;variable&gt; in &lt;group to iterate over&gt;</code>. In this case, the word <code>filename</code> is designated as the variable to be used over each iteration. In our case <code>SRR097977.fastq</code> and <code>SRR098026.fastq</code> will be substituted for <code>filename</code> because they fit the pattern of ending with .fastq in the directory we've specified. The next line of the for loop is <code>do</code>. The next line is the code that we want to execute. We are telling the loop to print the first two lines of each variable we iterate over. Finally, the word <code>done</code> ends the loop.</p> <p>After executing the loop, you should see the first two lines of both fastq files printed to the terminal. Let's create a loop that will save this information to a file.</p> <pre><code>$ for filename in *.fastq\n&gt; do\n&gt; head -n 2 ${filename} &gt;&gt; seq_info.txt\n&gt; done\n</code></pre> <p>When writing a loop, you will not be able to return to previous lines once you have pressed Enter. Remember that we can cancel the current command using</p> <ul> <li>Ctrl+C</li> </ul> <p>If you notice a mistake that is going to prevent your loop for executing correctly.</p> <p>Note that we are using <code>&gt;&gt;</code> to append the text to our <code>seq_info.txt</code> file. If we used <code>&gt;</code>, the <code>seq_info.txt</code> file would be rewritten every time the loop iterates, so it would only have text from the last variable used. Instead, <code>&gt;&gt;</code> adds to the end of the file.</p>"},{"location":"5_redirection/#using-basename-in-for-loops","title":"Using Basename in for loops","text":"<p>Basename is a function in UNIX that is helpful for removing a uniform part of a name from a list of files.

We call the basename function inside the parenthesis, then give our variable name from the for loop, in this case <code>${filename}</code>, and finally state that <code>.fastq</code> should be removed from the file name. It's important to note that we're not changing the actual files, we're creating a new variable called name.
