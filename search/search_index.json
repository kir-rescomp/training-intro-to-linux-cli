The most widely used way to interact with personal computers is called a graphical user interface (GUI). With a GUI, we give instructions by clicking a mouse and using menu-driven interactions.</p> <p>While the visual aid of a GUI makes it intuitive to learn, this way of delivering instructions to a computer scales very poorly. Imagine the following task: for a literature search, you have to copy the third line of one thousand text files in one thousand different directories and paste it into a single file. Using a GUI, you would not only be clicking at your desk for several hours, but you could potentially also commit an error in the process of completing this repetitive task. This is where we take advantage of the Unix shell. The Unix shell is both a command-line interface (CLI) and a scripting language, allowing such repetitive tasks to be done automatically and fast. With the proper commands, the shell can repeat tasks with or without some modification as many times as we want. Using the shell, the task in the literature example can be accomplished in seconds.</p>"},{"location":"0_background_introduction/#the-shell","title":"The Shell","text":"<p>A shell is a computer program that presents a command line interface which allows you to control your computer using commands entered with a keyboard instead of controlling graphical user interfaces (GUIs) with a mouse/keyboard/touchscreen combination.</p> Shell for Bioinformatics <ul> <li>Many bioinformatics tools can only be used through a command line interface. Many more have features and parameter options which are not available in the GUI. BLAST is an example. Many of the advanced functions are only accessible to users who know how to use a shell.</li> <li>The shell makes your work less boring. In bioinformatics you often need to repeat tasks with a large number of files. With the shell, you can automate those repetitive tasks and leave you free to do more exciting things.</li> <li>The shell makes your work less error-prone. When humans do the same thing a hundred different times (or even ten times), they\u2019re likely to make a mistake. Your computer can do the same thing a thousand times with no mistakes.</li> <li>The shell makes your work more reproducible. When you carry out your work in the command-line (rather than a GUI), your computer keeps a record of every step that you\u2019ve carried out which you can use to re-do your work when you need to. It also gives you a way to communicate unambiguously what you\u2019ve done, so that others can inspect or apply your process to new data.</li> <li>Many bioinformatic tasks require large amounts of computing power and can\u2019t realistically be run on your own machine. These tasks are best performed using remote computers or cloud computing, which can only be accessed through a shell. </li> </ul>"}]}
